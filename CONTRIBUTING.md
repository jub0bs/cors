# Contributing to jub0bs/cors

jub0bs/cors is an open-source project but currently does not accept external
contributions. My reasons echo [Dominik Honnef's][dominikh].

However, if you want to report a problem (a bug, a missing feature, a
misfeature, an idea for performance improvement, etc.), feel free to
[open an issue][new-issue].
